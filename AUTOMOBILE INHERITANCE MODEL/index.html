// Problem Statement :-
// You have been appointed as senior developer in Tata’s R&D department. The engineers there are lazy, they don’t want to do everything from scratch whenever they create a new model. They expect you to help them create an inheritance model for the automobiles.

// Description :-
// Implement an inheritance model for four wheeler automobiles.
// Implement using both object.create() and constructor functions().
// Think of properties of what can be inherited.
